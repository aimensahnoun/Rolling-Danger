In this scene, I Learned how to make the cannon look at the player once the trigger collider is hit , as well as adding a Line Rendered in order to show the player that they are in direct range for recieving damage. After a certain time is passed within range, force is applyed to the player pushing them backwards as the cannon shots them.
